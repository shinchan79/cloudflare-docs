Email Security allows you to configure Logpush to send detection data to an endpoint of your choice.

## Prerequisites

Before you can enable Logpush for Email Security, you will have to:

1. Create an [R2 bucket](/r2/get-started/#2-create-a-bucket).
2. Once you have created your R2 bucket, [create an API token](/r2/api/s3/tokens/). Under **Permissions**, ensure you select **Admin Read & Write**. 
3. Once you have created your R2 API Token, the dashboard will display an **Access Key ID** and a **Secret Access Key**. Save these two, as you will need them to set up Logpush later.
