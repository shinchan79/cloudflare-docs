title: Load Balancing with the China Network
sidebar:
  order: 15

---

## Prerequisites

To enable load balancers to be deployed to the [China Network](/china-network/), your zone will need to meet the following two criteria:

1. A valid [ICP license](/china-network/concepts/icp/) for the zone in question.
2. The zone must be provisioned with access to the China Network.

Once these two criteria are met, create a load balancer by sending a POST request to the following endpoint. To deploy to the China Network, the `networks` array in the API call must contain `jdcloud` as a value in addition to `cloudflare`. Refer to the [Cloudflare API documentation](/api/operations/load-balancers-create-load-balancer#request-body) for details on the required fields and their formats. When selecting a region for pool health checks, `China` is now available to be selected in both the dashboard and API.

```bash
https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/{zone_id}/load_balancers
```

## Limitations

Load balancers deployed to the China Network currently have the following limitations: 

1. Only cookie-based session affinity is supported.
2. Private network off-ramps (Tunnel, GRE, IPsec) are not supported.
