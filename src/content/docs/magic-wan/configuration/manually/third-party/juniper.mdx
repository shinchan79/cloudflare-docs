title: Juniper Networks SRX Series Firewalls
---

This tutorial provides information and examples of how to configure Juniper Networks SRX Series Firewalls with Magic WAN.

## Prerequisites

Confirm that you have the Cloudflare anycast IPs for your account. You should have two IPs allocated.

The goal is to configure two IPsec tunnels for each endpoint. This provides you with tunnel redundancy and the ability to load balance ingress and egress traffic (via ECMP).

Additionally, you will need to select two subnets (either `/31` or `/30`) for the Virtual Tunnel Interfaces (`st0.x`) to control what traffic is routed through the tunnels.

## Cloudflare Magic WAN configuration

This section of the document will cover the configuration of:

- Magic IPsec tunnels
- Magic static routes

### Magic IPsec tunnels

1. Start by [creating the IPsec tunnels](/magic-wan/configuration/manually/how-to/configure-tunnels/#add-tunnels) in the Cloudflare dashboard with the following values:
	- **Tunnel name**: Up to 15 characters (no spaces).
	- **Description** (Optional).
	- **Interface address**: This is the Virtual Tunnel Interface (VTI = `st0.x`) RFC 1918 address — the IP address specified in this dialog box is the address on the Cloudflare side of the tunnel.
	- **Customer endpoint**: This is the public IP address the tunnel will be established with on the Juniper SRX.
	- **Cloudflare endpoint**: One of the two Cloudflare anycast IP addresses.
	- **Pre-shared key**: Choose **Add pre-shared key later**.
2. Select **Add IPsec Tunnel** and fill in the values for the second tunnel to the same Juniper SRX:
	- The IP addresses used for the Interface address must be a unique RFC 1918 address (`/31` or `/30`).
	- The **Customer endpoint** is the same IP specified for the first tunnel.
	- The **Cloudflare Endpoint** for the second tunnel will be the second Cloudflare anycast IP provisioned for your account.
3. Select **Add tunnels**. We also recommend selecting **Test Tunnels** to ensure that the settings do not conflict with any other tunnels defined in your account and that you specified the correct anycast IP addresses.
4. Because we chose to add a pre-shared key at a later stage, you will see a warning indicator next to the tunnel names after creating them. This is expected behavior and indicates there is no pre-shared key associated with the tunnel.
5. Select **Edit** next to one of the tunnels to generate a pre-shared key.
6. Select **Generate a new pre-shared key** > **Update and generate a pre-shared key**. Make note of the pre-shared key and store it somewhere safe.
	:::note
	You can update the pre-shared key at any time by repeating this step. Just make sure to add the new value of the new pre-shared key to the corresponding tunnel configuration on the Juniper device.
	:::
7. Repeat the previous step for the second tunnel.
8. Expand the properties of the first tunnel, and take note of the **Tunnel ID** and **FQDN ID** values.
9. Repeat this step for the second tunnel.
	:::note
	These values are unique per tunnel and remain the same even if you update the pre-shared key. The only time these values change is if you delete and recreate the tunnel.
	:::

### Magic static routes

This document assumes that the **trust zone** behind the Juniper SRX firewall has a single subnet:
- `10.1.20.0/24`

[Magic static routes](/magic-wan/configuration/manually/how-to/configure-static-routes/) define which tunnel(s) to route traffic through for a given subnet. Since two tunnels are configured to each endpoint, it is necessary to configure two static routes.

Cloudflare leverages [equal-cost multi-path routing](/magic-wan/reference/traffic-steering/) to control steering of traffic across the tunnels. The default priority for each route is `100` — traffic will be load-balanced across the two tunnels equally. You can modify the priorities as needed.

1. Create a static route with the following values. Make sure you select the first tunnel in **Tunnel/Next hop**:
	- **Description:** The description for the static route assigned to your first tunnel.
	- **Prefix**: Enter the destination subnet for which this route is intended. For this example, it is `10.1.20.0/24` as stated above.
	- **Tunnel/Next hop**: Choose your first tunnel from the drop-down menu.
	- **Priority**: Default value is `100`.
	- **Region code**: Leave set to **All Regions** unless otherwise specified.
2. Select **Add Static Route** to add a second route for the same subnet. Make sure the second tunnel is selected in **Tunnel/Next hop**.
3. Select **Test routes** to ensure the settings will be accepted, and then select **Add Routes**.
4. Confirm the routes were added correctly in **Magic WAN** > **Configuration** > **Static Routes**.

## Juniper SRX configuration

The configuration settings in this document are based on JUNOS 21.4R3-S4.9.

There may be some differences in the syntax of the commands in the version on your SRX devices, however the principles are the same. Please refer to the Juniper product documentation for more information.

The following elements will be configured on the Juniper SRX firewall(s):

- Add tunnel interfaces (`st0.x`)
- Assign tunnel interfaces to a security zone
- Allow required protocols to both the tunnel and untrust security zones
- IKE configuration
- IPsec configuration
- Static routes
- Security policies

### Tunnel interfaces

1. Add two tunnel interfaces:

```txt
set interfaces st0 unit 0 family inet address 10.252.2.21/31
set interfaces st0 unit 1 family inet address 10.252.2.23/31
```

2. Confirm settings:

```txt
admin@srx220> show configuration interfaces st0
```
```txt output
unit 0 {
	family inet {
		address 10.252.2.21/31;
	}
}
unit 1 {
	family inet {
		address 10.252.2.23/31;
	}
}
```

### Security Zone (Cloudflare) - tunnel interfaces

Define a security zone and add both tunnel interfaces to it. At a minimum, the interfaces should allow `ping`, but this zone only contains point-to-point connections between the firewall and the customer network namespace. Setting it to `all` for system-services and protocols should be fine.

```txt
set security zones security-zone cloudflare interfaces st0.0 host-inbound-traffic system-services all
set security zones security-zone cloudflare interfaces st0.0 host-inbound-traffic
```

```txt
admin@srx220> show configuration security zones security-zone cloudflare
```
```txt output
interfaces {
	st0.0 {
		host-inbound-traffic {
			system-services {
				all;
			}
			protocols {
				all;
			}
		}
	}
	st0.1 {
		host-inbound-traffic {
			system-services {
				all;
			}
			protocols {
				all;
			}
		}
	}
}
```

### Security zone (untrust) - `host-inbound-traffic`

Add `ping` and `ike` to the security zone containing the external interface used to establish the IPsec tunnels to Cloudflare. If your security policy blocks `ping` by default, you will need to create a firewall-filter to allow ICMP from the [Cloudflare IPv4 address space](https://www.cloudflare.com/ips-v4) — not covered in this tutorial.

```txt
set security zones security-zone untrust interfaces ge-0/0/2.0 host-inbound-traffic system-services ping
set security zones security-zone untrust interfaces ge-0/0/2.0 host-inbound-traffic system-services ike
```

```txt
admin@srx220> show configuration security zones security-zone untrust
```
```txt output
interfaces {
	ge-0/0/2.0 {
		host-inbound-traffic {
			system-services {
				ping;
				ike;
			}
		}
	}
}
```

### IKE - Phase 1

#### IKE proposal

Add an IKE proposal that specifies the [Phase 1 Configuration Parameters](/magic-wan/reference/tunnels/#supported-configuration-parameters):

```txt
set security ike proposal cf_ike_magic_wan_prop authentication-method pre-shared-keys
set security ike proposal cf_ike_magic_wan_prop dh-group group14
set security ike proposal cf_ike_magic_wan_prop authentication-algorithm sha-256
set security ike proposal cf_ike_magic_wan_prop encryption-algorithm aes-256-cbc
set security ike proposal cf_ike_magic_wan_prop lifetime-seconds 28800
```

#### IKE policies

Define two IKE policies — one for each of the two Magic IPsec tunnels:

**Tunnel 1 (SRX220_IPSEC_01)**

```txt
set security ike policy cf_magic_wan_pol_01 mode main
set security ike policy cf_magic_wan_pol_01 proposals cf_ike_magic_wan_prop
set security ike policy cf_magic_wan_pol_01 pre-shared-key ascii-text "$9$CnJ0tO1<REDACTED>NwsmfTQ69"
```

**Tunnel 2 (SRX220_IPSEC_02)**

```txt
set security ike policy cf_magic_wan_pol_02 mode main
set security ike policy cf_magic_wan_pol_02 proposals cf_ike_magic_wan_prop
set security ike policy cf_magic_wan_pol_02 pre-shared-key ascii-text "$9$sH4GD<REDACTED>HqQzIEclvL"
```

#### IKE gateways

Define two IKE gateways — one for each of the two Magic IPsec tunnels. In the examples below, note the use of the FQDN ID value obtained from the Cloudflare dashboard in the `local-identity` hostname setting.

**Tunnel 1 (SRX220_IPSEC_01)**

```txt
set security ike gateway cf_magic_wan_gw_01 ike-policy cf_magic_wan_pol_01
set security ike gateway cf_magic_wan_gw_01 address 162.xx.xx.164
set security ike gateway cf_magic_wan_gw_01 local-identity hostname 755339a<REDACTED>1ffcc01.33145236.ipsec.cloudflare.com
set security ike gateway cf_magic_wan_gw_01 external-interface ge-0/0/2.0
set security ike gateway cf_magic_wan_gw_01 version v2-only
```

**Tunnel 2 (SRX220_IPSEC_02)**

```txt
set security ike gateway cf_magic_wan_gw_02 ike-policy cf_magic_wan_pol_02
set security ike gateway cf_magic_wan_gw_02 address 172.xx.xx.164
set security ike gateway cf_magic_wan_gw_02 local-identity hostname abac7146c<REDACTED>3de918e0.33145236.ipsec.cloudflare.com
set security ike gateway cf_magic_wan_gw_02 external-interface ge-0/0/2.0
set security ike gateway cf_magic_wan_gw_02 version v2-only
```

### Phase 2 - IPsec

#### IPsec proposal

Add an IPsec proposal that specifies the [Phase 2 Configuration Parameters](/magic-wan/reference/tunnels/#supported-configuration-parameters):

```txt
set security ipsec proposal cf_ipsec_magic_wan_prop authentication-algorithm hmac-sha-256-128
set security ipsec proposal cf_ipsec_magic_wan_prop encryption-algorithm aes-256-cbc
set security ipsec proposal cf_ipsec_magic_wan_prop lifetime-seconds 28800
```

#### IPsec policies

Define two IPsec policies — one for each of the two Magic IPsec tunnels. It is crucial to ensure that:

- [Anti-replay](/magic-wan/reference/anti-replay-protection/) protection is disabled.
  - Use [`no-anti-replay`](https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/junos/interfaces-adaptive-services/topics/ref/statement/no-anti-replay-edit-services.html) as the setting
- The SRX is the tunnel initiator:
  - Cloudflare will not instantiate the tunnel
  - If the SRX does not initiate the tunnel, then the tunnel will not be established until there is an attempt to connect to resources through the tunnel
  - Use [`establish-tunnels immediately`](https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/junos/interfaces-adaptive-services/topics/ref/statement/establish-tunnels-edit-services-ipsec-vpn.html) as the setting.

**Tunnel 1 (SRX220_IPSEC_01)**

```txt
set security ipsec vpn cf_magic_wan_tun_01 bind-interface st0.0
set security ipsec vpn cf_magic_wan_tun_01 ike gateway cf_magic_wan_gw_01
set security ipsec vpn cf_magic_wan_tun_01 ike no-anti-replay
set security ipsec vpn cf_magic_wan_tun_01 ike ipsec-policy cf_magic_wan_ipsec_pol
set security ipsec vpn cf_magic_wan_tun_01 establish-tunnels immediately
```

**Tunnel 2 (SRX220_IPSEC_02)**

```txt
set security ipsec vpn cf_magic_wan_tun_02 bind-interface st0.1
set security ipsec vpn cf_magic_wan_tun_02 ike gateway cf_magic_wan_gw_02
set security ipsec vpn cf_magic_wan_tun_02 ike no-anti-replay
set security ipsec vpn cf_magic_wan_tun_02 ike ipsec-policy cf_magic_wan_ipsec_pol
set security ipsec vpn cf_magic_wan_tun_02 establish-tunnels immediately
```

### Static routes

This configuration only factors in one local site (`10.1.20.0/24`). In this example, we assume devices in the trust zone need to route traffic to a remote subnet that is at another Magic WAN-protected site (`10.1.100.0/24`).

Define a static route on the SRX to route traffic to `10.1.100.0/24` with redundant routes that reference each of the two tunnels. There are two ways to accomplish this:

**By adding two destinations for the same route:**

```txt
set routing-options static route 10.1.100.0/24 next-hop 10.252.2.20
set routing-options static route 10.1.100.0/24 next-hop 10.252.2.22
```

```txt
admin@srx220> show configuration routing-options static
```
```txt output
route 10.1.100.0/24 next-hop [ 10.252.2.20 10.252.2.22 ];
```

**Or using the [qualified-next-hop](https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/junos/static-routing/topics/ref/statement/qualified-next-hop-edit-routing-options.html) option:**

```txt
admin@srx220> show configuration routing-options | display set
set routing-options static route 0.0.0.0/0 next-hop 23.XX.XXX.46
set routing-options static route 10.1.100.0/24 next-hop 10.252.2.20
set routing-options static route 10.1.100.0/24 qualified-next-hop 10.252.2.22
```
```txt output
static {
	route 0.0.0.0/0 next-hop 23.XX.XXX.46;
	route 10.1.100.0/24 {
		next-hop 10.252.2.20;
		qualified-next-hop 10.252.2.22;
	}
}
```

### Security policies

Define security policies to permit traffic flows destined for Magic WAN protected resources. The source/destination zones will need to incorporate the zone containing the tunnel interfaces.

There are two very simple rules to allow traffic bidirectionally — it is generally recommended to start with a similar policy, then to add more stringent rules once general connectivity is established successfully.

**From Cloudflare to *trust*:**

```txt
set security policies from-zone cloudflare to-zone trust policy cloudflare_to_trust match source-address any
set security policies from-zone cloudflare to-zone trust policy cloudflare_to_trust match destination-address any
set security policies from-zone cloudflare to-zone trust policy cloudflare_to_trust match application any
set security policies from-zone cloudflare to-zone trust policy cloudflare_to_trust then permit
set security policies from-zone cloudflare to-zone trust policy cloudflare_to_trust then log session-close
```

```txt
admin@srx220> show configuration security policies from-zone trust to-zone cloudflare
```
```txt output
policy trust_to_cloudflare_permit {
	match {
		source-address any;
		destination-address any;
		application any;
	}
	then {
		permit;
		log {
			session-close;
		}
	}
}
```

**From *trust* to *Cloudflare*:**

```txt
set security policies from-zone trust to-zone cloudflare policy trust_to_cloudflare_permit match source-address any
set security policies from-zone trust to-zone cloudflare policy trust_to_cloudflare_permit match destination-address any
set security policies from-zone trust to-zone cloudflare policy trust_to_cloudflare_permit match application any
set security policies from-zone trust to-zone cloudflare policy trust_to_cloudflare_permit then permit
set security policies from-zone trust to-zone cloudflare policy trust_to_cloudflare_permit then log session-close
```

To confirm, run:

```txt
admin@srx220> show configuration security policies from-zone trust to-zone cloudflare
```
```txt output
policy trust_to_cloudflare_permit {
	match {
		source-address any;
		destination-address any;
		application any;
	}
	then {
		permit;
		log {
			session-close;
		}
	}
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Validate tunnel connectivity

There are several diagnostic commands available to view the status of IPsec tunnels.

#### Phase 1

[`show security ike active-peer`](https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/junos/vpn-ipsec/topics/ref/command/show-security-ike-active-peer.html)

```txt
admin@srx220> show security ike active-peer
```
```txt output
Remote Address            Port     Peer IKE-ID     XAUTH username    Assigned IP
162.XXX.XX.164            500      162.XX.XXX.164  not available     0.0.0.0
172.XX.XXX.164            500      172.XX.XXX.164  not available     0.0.0.0
```

[`show security ike security-associations`](https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/junos/vpn-ipsec/topics/ref/command/show-security-ike-security-associations.html)

```txt
admin@srx220> show security ike security-associations
```
```txt output

3628775 UP     b2d9a698b6224fc9  7fb1a9f81db0611c  IKEv2          172.XX.XXX.164
```

#### Phase 2

[`show security ipsec security-associations`](https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/junos/vpn-ipsec/topics/ref/command/show-security-ipsec-security-associations.html)

```txt
admin@srx220> show security ipsec security-associations
```
```txt output

```

### IKE `traceoptions`

It is very helpful to enable debug logging via `traceoptions` while setting up the tunnels. The log data can be exceptionally useful in determining if there are issues and, if so, where they might be occurring.

#### Enable IKE `traceoptions`

```txt
set security ike traceoptions file ike-debug.log
set security ike traceoptions file size 1m
set security ike traceoptions file files 3
set security ike traceoptions file world-readable
set security ike traceoptions flag all
```

The log file can be viewed by doing the following:

1. From an operational mode, run **start shell**.
2. Use the `tail` command to view the contents of the log file in real-time:
	```txt
	tail -f /var/log/ike-debug.log
	```
3. Press  <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> when finished.
4. Type `exit` to return to the operational mode prompt.

Either deactivate `traceoptions` or delete `traceoptions` once debugging is complete.

#### Deactivate IKE `traceoptions`

```txt
deactivate security ike traceoptions
```

Confirm `traceoptions` is deactivated with:

```txt
admin@srx220> show configuration security ike
```
```txt output
inactive: traceoptions {
	file ike-debug.log size m files 3 world-readable;
	flag all;
}
```

#### IPsec `traceoptions`

It is also possible to enable `traceoptions` for IPsec. However, it is not possible to specify the name of the log file. All events are logged to `/var/log/kmd`.

```txt
set security ipsec traceoptions flag all
```
